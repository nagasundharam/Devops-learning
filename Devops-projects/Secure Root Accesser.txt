Question :Secure Root access 


Reason ==>

 =====>  Why restrict direct root SSH access?

   ======> Security: The root account has full system privileges. If someone guesses or cracks the root password, they have total control.
	
   ======> Audit & Accountability: Using normal users + sudo makes it easier to track who did what.
 
   ======> Reduce brute-force attacks: Root is a common target for automated attacks.

	==> How to restrict root SSH access
              1️⃣ Open the SSH configuration file
                     === >sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config

              2️⃣ Find the line with PermitRootLogin

                     It might look like:

                       #PermitRootLogin prohibit-password


                     Change it to:

                        PermitRootLogin no
             
               This disables root login completely.
          
              Optionally you want to allow some people to login
